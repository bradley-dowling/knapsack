### Bradley Dowling CSE222 PA5 - "The Knapsack Problem"

This is an assignment exploring recursive functions and dynamic programming. The main program ingests
an item list (containing weights and values for different items) from a database and a user specified 
knapsack capacity (maximum weight), and prints out the maximum value that can be attained from a combination
of items in the item list where the total weight of the items is less than the user specified capacity.

Use the makefile to compile the program, and run the program with the "knapsack (capacity) (database file)" command.
